The internet, the devices connected to it, impact our lives everyday,it allows us to things in ways we never have before, from your emails for work at home, to watching a movie on in the middle of a deep revine in Alaska on Netflix. The inspiration to write this story came to me while I was on a roadtrip with my family, I noticed that everybody except the driver was occupied on their deivces, including myself (because I'm writing this). People go into this partially aware state where the world out side of you fade away, and you become focused on just the one thing that your working on. 

This can be quite dangerous, especially in situations in which unexpected events occur.
